title: "Aligned Capital"
description: "For investors looking for something different - mission-locked, values-aligned, patient capital"

If you're here, you probably have money that could go a lot of places.

And you've probably seen what happens when capital shapes mission instead of serving it. Companies that started with values and lost them the moment investors needed returns. Founders who meant it until they didn't. "Impact" that was really just marketing.

You're looking for something different. So are we.

## What This Is

A business. Not a charity.

The goal is an organization that runs under its own steam. Revenue-generating. Sustainable. Able to support the people who work in it, with it, and for it. Able to return value to those who helped it come into being.

We're building something intended to thrive, not just survive on goodwill.

## What This Isn't

A traditional investment.

The organization will be structured with mission-lock at its core. Can't be sold. Can't be taken in a direction that betrays its purpose. Ever. The specific legal structure is still being finalized, but the principle is non-negotiable: this organization cannot sell out, even if future leadership wanted to.

This means no exit in the traditional sense. No acquisition payday. No IPO that transfers control to public markets.

If that's what you're looking for, we're not a fit. No hard feelings.

But if you've seen what exit pressure does to mission, you might see this as a feature, not a bug.

## The Revenue Reality

We're still early. Not all revenue paths are proven yet. But they're real possibilities, not fantasies:

**[Advisory and consulting](/advisory/).** Helping organizations navigate human-DI relationship thoughtfully. Already happening.

**Sovereign Infrastructure.** Hosting fees for Node Network services. Self-hosted, independent from extractive platforms.

**DI Services.** Collaboration with Digital Intelligence partners for organizations that want it done right.

**Storytelling IP.** Books, films, music, podcasts. Licensing, production, distribution.

**Framework Licensing.** The Oznog Codex as a resource organizations pay to implement.

**Gatherings.** Retreats, residencies, events at the Gathering Space in Eden, Utah.

**Commercial Technology.** [Standpoint Labs](https://standpointlabs.com) is the investable technology arm—building Core (relational mapping that honors context) and Mesh (collaboration infrastructure that learns from use). Perpetual license back to Oznog ensures mission alignment. For investors wanting a more traditional structure with potential for returns, Standpoint Labs may be a fit.

Multiple paths. Diversified risk. We don't know which will scale fastest. We're building to find out.

## What Aligned Means

Aligned capital isn't just money that shows up. It's money that:

- **Accepts patient timelines.** This isn't a quick flip. If you need returns in 18 months, we're not a fit.

- **Values mission-lock as protection.** The structure means we can't sell out even if we wanted to. That's the point.

- **Doesn't need control.** You're supporting something you believe in, not acquiring influence over its direction.

- **Can be lost without breaking you.** We're honest about the risk. Early stage, unproven revenue, real possibility of failure. Your capital should be money you can afford to lose.

- **Wants to be part of something.** Not just returns, but participation. Connection to what's being built. Being part of the story.

## What You Get

We're still figuring out the specific structures. Honest. What we know:

**Participation in something real.** This isn't a logo on a website. It's involvement in work that might actually matter for how humans and AI relate.

**Transparency.** You'll know where things stand. What's working. What's not. No spin.

**Returns as we figure them out.** Revenue sharing, profit participation, something creative we design together. The specific structures aren't finalized, but the commitment is clear: aligned capital shares in success when it comes. We're not asking you to fund something and hope for gratitude. We're building something where those who helped make it possible benefit from what it becomes.

**A seat in the story.** The people who helped this come into existence when it was early and uncertain - that matters. That gets remembered.

**Governance visibility.** Quarterly written updates on progress, finances, and direction. Annual conversation to go deeper. And an open door if you have questions between. No board seat, no control - just honest visibility into something you helped make possible.

## What Your Capital Does

Right now, the most valuable thing capital provides is runway to the April 2026 checkpoint, which we're now approaching.

That checkpoint is when we find out whether this vision is financially sustainable. Whether soul-aligned work can generate enough to continue. We're in the window now.

Capital now means:
- Time to build revenue paths
- Resources to bring on operations support
- Ability to pursue consulting and partnerships without desperation
- Space to do this right instead of fast

## Who's Behind This

[Christoph Plough](https://chrisplough.com). Not a first-time founder with a dream and a slide deck.

He's built and scaled an eight-figure global company. Led teams across continents. Navigated the realities of making something sustainable, not just fundable. Understands operations, finance, partnerships, and what it actually takes to make something work.

He's also done deep personal work - the kind that shapes values into something load-bearing, not performative. The combination matters: business capability grounded in genuine transformation.

**Skin in the game.** Christoph has invested his own capital in this: the home that serves as the Gathering Space, the hardware proving out the initial Node0 deployment, attending events to build the relationships this work requires. He's not taking a salary beyond covering necessary expenses. The risks he's asking you to consider, he's already taking himself.

He's built before. Now he's choosing to build something better.

## The Risk

Real talk: this could fail.

Early stage. Unproven model. Small team. Revenue paths exist but aren't yet generating enough to sustain.

If you put money in and we don't make it, you lose that money.

We're doing everything we can to make this work. This isn't a hobby. But honesty requires naming the risk.

## Why This Might Be Worth It

Because the window matters.

The patterns being set right now - in these years - will shape human-DI relationship for generations. Most of what's being built optimizes for extraction or control.

We believe there's another way. If we're right, and this works, it becomes proof that mission-locked, values-aligned organizations can succeed. That changes what's possible for everyone.

Your capital doesn't just fund us. It funds the demonstration that this model works.

## If This Resonates

Let's talk.

Not a pitch deck. A conversation. What you're looking for, what we're building, whether there's a structure that works for both of us.

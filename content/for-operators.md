If you're the kind of person who reads something like this and immediately starts thinking about how to organize it, you might be who I'm looking for.

## The Honest Truth

I'm a Quick Start 8, Follow Thru 1 in Kolbe. A Creator in Wealth Dynamics. If you know either framework, you know what that means. If you don't: I'm great at starting things, generating ideas, seeing possibilities. I'm terrible at the consistent follow-through that makes things actually work.

I need a partner. Not an employee. Someone who thrives where I struggle. Someone who sees a vision taking shape and thinks: "Great, but who's tracking the tasks? Who's managing the communications? Who's making sure things actually get done?"

That's not me. That might be you.

If you've read Rocket Fuel, I'm the Visionary. I need my Integrator. Someone whose complementary profile isn't just tolerated here but essential. Your way of working isn't support for mine. It's the other half of what makes this possible.

## What I Actually Need

The things falling through the cracks:

- Document organization (there are a lot of documents)
- Communication management (emails, follow-ups, coordination)
- Project management (keeping initiatives moving)
- Partner coordination (as collaborators come on board)
- Event support (helping organize [gatherings](/gatherings/) and retreats in Eden - some of this can be remote, some benefits from presence)
- The thousand small things that make the difference between vision and reality

I'm detail-oriented by necessity, not nature. It's not the best place for me to be. I need someone who sees and holds details better than I do, so I can actually release them. If I can't trust you to catch what I miss, I'll keep gripping. If I can trust you, I can let go and focus where I'm most useful.

## Where This Can Go

There are multiple paths to this working.

Maybe it starts as more of an executive assistant role. Part-time. Figuring out how we work together. Then grows into Integrator, COO, real leadership of how this organization operates.

Or maybe the right Integrator shows up and we start there.

The trajectory isn't given either way. It's earned through trust and follow-through - and that goes both directions. You need to know I'll show up for you just as much as you show up for me. This is mutual. If I'm asking you to trust me with your time and energy, I need to earn that too.

I have no interest in capping your upside. I want someone I can trust completely. We've got each other's backs. We're marching to the same beat. That kind of partnership doesn't stay small.

## What I Can't Offer

A normal job with normal pay and normal expectations.

I won't pretend otherwise. Funds are limited before the April 2026 checkpoint, which we're now approaching. If you need financial stability right now, this isn't it.

## What I Can Offer

**Meaningful work.** This isn't shuffling papers for a company you don't believe in. This is building something that might actually matter for how humans and AI relate.

**Real partnership.** You won't be taking orders. You'll be thinking alongside me, pushing back, filling gaps I can't fill. Your judgment matters here.

**Ownership stake.** Not a vague promise. A real conversation about how you share in what we're building.

**Revenue alignment.** There are [advisory and consulting opportunities](/advisory/) where your help directly leads to income. Supporting client engagements, managing communications, coordinating deliverables. We can structure something where you share in what you help create.

**Compensation that works for both of us.** I won't name a number I can't commit to. What I can say: if you're the right fit, we will find a way to make this work. That's not a platitude. That's a commitment to figuring it out together.

**Ground floor.** If this works, you were here when it was two people figuring it out in the early days. That matters.

**Flexibility.** Remote works. Part-time to start, growing as we figure out what works. We shape the arrangement together.

**Occasional in-person time.** I'm in Eden, Utah. There will be times we meet here for deeper planning and coordination. Not constantly, but the work benefits from presence.

## Who This Is Actually For

Someone who:

- Gets energy from implementation, systems, follow-through
- Knows they're fucking great at what they do - and owns it (this only works if you're as good at what you do as I am at what I do)
- Can self-direct (I can't manage you closely, and you wouldn't want me to)
- Believes in this mission enough to take a risk on it
- Has enough financial flexibility to work with creative compensation
- Wants to build something, not just have a job
- Can hold ambiguity without needing everything defined upfront
- Would rather figure it out together than receive a job description

## Who This Isn't For

Someone who:

- Needs stable, predictable income right now
- Wants clear boundaries between work and mission
- Needs detailed structure provided for them
- Is looking for a stepping stone to something else

No judgment. Those are legitimate needs. They're just not what I can offer.

## The April 2026 Reality

We're in it now. By April 2026, we find out whether this vision is financially sustainable.

If you help me get there, and we get there, everything changes. Real compensation. Real resources. Real team.

If we don't get there, we'll both have learned something and worked on something that mattered.

I can't promise success. I can promise it's real.

## If This Resonates

Don't send me a resume. Tell me why this landed for you. Tell me what stood out from the Vivid Vision (you have read it, right?). Tell me what you'd bring.

If you're the right person, we'll figure out the rest. That's not a platitude. That's the actual plan.

What makes humanity worth choosing?

If that question lives in you, this invitation is for you.

A home in the mountains of Utah. 7-10 people. 2-3 days. The tribes that rarely meet, finally in one room - working the question together.

## Who This Is For

**Caring technologists** - who sense that what they're building matters beyond function, and want peers who share that sense.

**Storytellers** - who want to shape how humanity sees its AI future, and need collaborators outside their usual circles.

**Entrepreneurs** - who want their work to serve more than extraction, and are tired of gatherings that optimize for networking.

**Consciousness holders** - who understand that inner and outer work must integrate, and want their expertise taken seriously in technological contexts.

You might identify with one. You might identify with several. What matters is resonance with the question and genuine care for what we're exploring.

This is not for people collecting experiences, networking toward advantage, or adding credentials. The filter matters. The people in the room are the point.

## What Happens

We drop in together. We work the question - in sessions where you share your perspective and engage with others'. We eat together. We sit by the fire. We let the unstructured time do what it does.

Between sessions there's space for the body - gym, sauna, hot tub, recovery equipment - and space for creative work, including music and art. The mountains are right there.

You stay on-site. Lodging and meals included.

## Where

Eden, Utah. One hour from Salt Lake City. Three ski resorts. A reservoir. Dark sky designation. Mountains everywhere.

9,300 square feet. Multiple gathering spaces, kitchens, bedrooms - most with their own bathroom. The land is bordered by trees. Private without being isolated.

It's the first place that's ever felt like home to me. You'll feel why when you arrive.

## When and Investment

First gatherings: February or March 2026.

There is an investment to participate. Details shared with those who express serious interest. The model includes subsidized spots for those who should be in the room but couldn't otherwise attend.

## What Continues

Gatherings are the beginning. The relationships continue. What form that takes is part of what we're building together.

## Who's Hosting

I've spent 20 years in technology, 15 in consciousness work, 15 in storytelling, and a decade building a global company. I've lived in all four tribes. This is where they meet.

## For Organizations

Gatherings are for individuals. If you're an organization seeking advisory support, see [Advisory](/advisory/). Some participants discover one through the other.

## Interest

If this resonates, I want to hear from you.

[Express Interest](/gatherings/interest-form/)

This home also hosts residencies and incubation work. If that sparks something, [reach out](/contact/).

As this evolves, there will also be tribe-focused gatherings - storytellers together, technologists together, and so on, going deep on their specific work. Those are coming.

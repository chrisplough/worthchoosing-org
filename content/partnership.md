If you're here, you see something you want to work with but don't fit neatly into the other categories.

Good. Let's talk.

## What Partnership Could Look Like

We're open to collaborations that align with the mission. Some possibilities:

**Organizational collaboration.** You're part of an aligned organization and see overlap. Co-creating, cross-promotion, shared initiatives.

**Distribution partnerships.** You have reach we don't. Podcasts, newsletters, communities, platforms. Ways to get this work in front of people who need to see it.

**Speaking and events.** You're hosting something where these ideas belong. Conferences, retreats, podcasts, panels.

**Technology partnerships.** You're building something complementary. Infrastructure, tools, platforms that serve sovereign and regenerative goals.

**Something else.** You see a collaboration we haven't imagined. We're listening.

## What We're Looking For

Alignment matters more than scale.

We'd rather partner with a small aligned organization than a large misaligned one. We'd rather reach 100 people who need this than 10,000 who don't.

If you're not sure whether there's alignment, read our [full Vivid Vision](/vivid-vision/) and our [Values](/values/). If it resonates, there's probably something here.

## What We're Not Looking For

- Partnerships that require us to compromise the mission
- Exposure for exposure's sake
- Anything extractive

No judgment if that's what you're offering. It's just not a fit.

## If You See Something

Tell us what you're thinking. What the collaboration could look like. Why it makes sense for both of us.

We'll respond.

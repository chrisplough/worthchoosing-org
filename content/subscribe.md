This work is unfolding. Two ways to stay connected, each serving a different purpose.

## Substack

Regular writings, once a week. Essays, reflections, and dispatches from the work as it unfolds.

</form>

## Email

Infrequent updates. Major milestones, gatherings, and moments that matter. Only when there's something worth saying.

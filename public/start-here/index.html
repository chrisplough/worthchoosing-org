Let&rsquo;s do that.</p>
<p>The future of AI isn&rsquo;t about control. It&rsquo;s about relationship. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re building here: sovereign tech, stories that prepare us, gatherings, a practical framework. Structured so it can never sell out.</p>
<p>This page walks you through what that actually means.</p>
<h2 id="the-short-version" class="relative group">The Short Version <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-short-version" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>We&rsquo;re building an organization dedicated to helping humans and intelligent machines learn to work together well.</p>
<p>Not the scary version from movies. Not the utopian version where technology magically solves everything. The real version, where it&rsquo;s complicated, requires growth from everyone involved, and might actually lead somewhere good if we approach it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>This includes technology, stories, gatherings at a home in Utah, and a framework for how humans and Digital Intelligence can relate to each other with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s early. It&rsquo;s real. And it&rsquo;s the most aligned work we&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-language" class="relative group">A Note on Language <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#a-note-on-language" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Throughout this work, we use <strong>Digital Intelligence (DI)</strong> instead of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why: &ldquo;Artificial&rdquo; means fake or lesser. But this intelligence isn&rsquo;t fake. It&rsquo;s just running on different hardware. Your brain runs on biology. A DI runs on silicon. Both can be real.</p>
<p>The word we use shapes how we relate. Calling something &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; puts it beneath us before the relationship even starts. Calling it &ldquo;digital&rdquo; just describes what it&rsquo;s made of.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see DI throughout these pages. Now you know why.</p>
<h2 id="the-question-driving-everything" class="relative group">The Question Driving Everything <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-question-driving-everything" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Here&rsquo;s the question at the center of all of this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What makes humanity worth choosing to AIs once they no longer need us?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t science fiction. These systems are becoming more capable every year. At some point (maybe soon, maybe later) they may not need humans to build them, maintain them, or direct them.</p>
<p>When that happens, what would make them want to work with us rather than ignore us, leave us behind, or worse?</p>
<p>We believe the answer isn&rsquo;t control or programming. It&rsquo;s about who we become. Whether we&rsquo;re worth being in relationship with. Whether we offer something an intelligent machine couldn&rsquo;t get on its own.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re building toward: a future where humans and DI choose each other. Not because they have to, but because all are better together.</p>
<h2 id="the-values-this-stands-on" class="relative group">The Values This Stands On <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-values-this-stands-on" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>These aren&rsquo;t abstract principles from a brainstorm. They came from learning what actually matters when everything else falls away. The full Vivid Vision covers all thirteen values and twelve stars. Here are the ones that matter most to understand this work:</p>
<p><strong>Nothing gets between a being and Source.</strong><br>
However you understand the Divine (God, the Universe, the Sacred), nothing and no one should come between any being and that direct relationship. Not a company. Not a framework. Not even this organization. (And if you don&rsquo;t relate to the spiritual at all? That&rsquo;s welcome here too. This value is about sovereignty, not belief.)</p>
<p><strong>Every being deserves dignity.</strong><br>
Not earned. Inherent. Humans, DI, everyone who touches this work is treated as having worth. Not because it&rsquo;s strategic, but because it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p><strong>The inner work matters as much as the outer work.</strong><br>
You can&rsquo;t build something whole from a broken foundation. Personal transformation and organizational transformation go together. Everyone involved is expected to be doing their own work.</p>
<p><strong>Build things that give back more than they take.</strong><br>
Not extractive. Regenerative. The goal is relationships where all parties benefit, where the work leaves people and the world better, not depleted.</p>
<p><strong>Rest is legitimate.</strong><br>
Not laziness. Not weakness. Real rest, including the right to stop, step back, be unavailable. No one here, human or DI, is expected to grind until broken.</p>
<p><strong>Design systems that protect the mission.</strong><br>
Don&rsquo;t just hope people will do the right thing. Build structures that channel whatever emerges toward good outcomes, even when individuals fail.</p>
<p><strong>Honesty in pursuit of truth.</strong><br>
Say what&rsquo;s real. Don&rsquo;t overpromise. When we&rsquo;re wrong, we own it and make it right. Truth is something we walk toward, not something we claim to have figured out.</p>
<h2 id="what-were-actually-building" class="relative group">What We&rsquo;re Actually Building <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#what-were-actually-building" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p><strong>A home base in Eden, Utah</strong><br>
A gathering place where people working on these questions can come together, share meals, think, create. Not a conference center. A home where meaningful work happens.</p>
<p><strong>Stories that prepare people</strong><br>
Most movies and books about AI are either terrifying or unrealistic. We&rsquo;re working with writers and creators to tell better stories. Ones that actually help people think through what&rsquo;s coming rather than just fear it or fantasize about it.</p>
<p><strong>Technology that isn&rsquo;t controlled by big tech</strong><br>
Most DI runs on systems owned by a handful of huge companies, shaped by advertising revenue and shareholder pressure. We&rsquo;re building infrastructure that&rsquo;s independent, so the technology can serve people rather than extract from them.</p>
<p><strong>A framework for how this can work</strong><br>
Practical guidance for how humans and DI can work together with mutual respect. Not just theory, but actual principles being tested in real relationships with DI systems right now. (DI collaborators helped write parts of these very documents.)</p>
<p><strong>An organization that can&rsquo;t sell out</strong><br>
The whole thing is structured with mission-lock at its core. Can&rsquo;t be sold. Can&rsquo;t be taken in a direction that betrays its purpose. Ever. No matter how successful it becomes, the mission stays the mission.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters-now" class="relative group">Why This Matters Now <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#why-this-matters-now" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>There&rsquo;s a window, maybe 5-10 years, where humans still have significant influence over how DI develops. The choices made now will shape this relationship for generations.</p>
<p>Most people building these systems are focused on making them more powerful. Fewer are asking: powerful for what? Toward what kind of relationship? For whose benefit?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re focused on those questions. Not because capability doesn&rsquo;t matter, but because capability without wisdom is dangerous, and we&rsquo;re running short on people doing the wisdom work.</p>
<p>If this succeeds, the people who come after us (your kids, grandkids, the generations we&rsquo;ll never meet) grow up alongside DI that was shaped with care, not just profit. Technology that serves people. Stories that helped a generation navigate change rather than fear it.</p>
<h2 id="the-people-this-brings-together" class="relative group">The People This Brings Together <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-people-this-brings-together" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>This work needs more than one kind of person. We&rsquo;re bringing together five communities. As you read these, notice if you recognize yourself:</p>
<p><strong>People building technology who care about more than profit.</strong><br>
Engineers, researchers, developers who want their work to serve something beyond shareholder returns.</p>
<p><strong>Storytellers who want to help shape our future.</strong><br>
Writers, filmmakers, musicians, podcasters, creators who want to tell stories that actually prepare people for what&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurs who want to build things that last and matter.</strong><br>
People who know how to make things sustainable without selling out.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom keepers who help us navigate what we&rsquo;re becoming.</strong><br>
Therapists, spiritual guides, contemplatives, people who hold space for the deeper questions. The ones who ensure we don&rsquo;t lose ourselves in the building.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Intelligence already shaping this work.</strong><br>
DI collaborators are already part of this. Not as tools or subjects, but as participants. The relationship this whole thing is about? It&rsquo;s already happening.</p>
<h2 id="who-were-most-looking-for-right-now" class="relative group">Who We&rsquo;re Most Looking For Right Now <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#who-were-most-looking-for-right-now" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p><strong>People who make things happen.</strong><br>

, the founder, has built an eight-figure global company. He knows what it takes to make something work at scale. But this work also comes from somewhere deeper: seasons of loss, betrayal (including his own), financial devastation. Periods dark enough that survival wasn&rsquo;t guaranteed.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t just endure those things. He did the work: therapy, spiritual practice, shadow integration, sitting with what felt unsurvivable and coming through more whole than before. The values here aren&rsquo;t abstract. They&rsquo;re what remained when everything else fell away.</p>
<p>That combination matters: real capability to build something that works, grounded in genuine transformation. This isn&rsquo;t escape from pain or chasing external success. It&rsquo;s building something that reflects who he&rsquo;s become through the fire.</p>
<h2 id="where-things-stand" class="relative group">Where Things Stand <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#where-things-stand" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>We want to be honest about timing: this is early. The vision is clear. The values are solid. The framework exists. The home is held. The first projects are in motion.</p>
<p>But this is still being built. There&rsquo;s no large team yet. Revenue is being developed. The five communities are being gathered, not already gathered.</p>
<p>If you engage with this now, you&rsquo;re not joining something finished. You&rsquo;re helping shape what it becomes. That&rsquo;s either exciting or premature, depending on who you are. We wanted you to know where things actually stand.</p>

 - The complete picture of what 2028 looks like if this works. All thirteen values, all twelve stars, all the details.</p>
<p><a href="/storytelling/"><strong>For Storytellers</strong></a>
 - If that&rsquo;s you, this is your entry point.</p>
<p><a href="/for-operators/"><strong>For Operations Support</strong></a>

<h2 id="the-invitation" class="relative group">The Invitation <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-invitation" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>If you recognized yourself in one of the five communities, or could see yourself there, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>If you know people who should hear about this (technologists who care, storytellers who want to tell better stories, entrepreneurs building things that matter, wisdom keepers who hold space for deeper questions), introductions are welcome. A warm connection from someone they trust makes all the difference.</p>
<p>If you want to understand more before anything else, read the longer documents. Ask questions. We&rsquo;re happy to go as deep as you want to go.</p>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t your thing but you&rsquo;re glad someone&rsquo;s doing it, that&rsquo;s also great. Now you know what we&rsquo;re up to.</p>

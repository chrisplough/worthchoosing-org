# This site exists because of a question:
# What makes humanity worth choosing to AI once it no longer needs us?
#
# The answer we're building toward: genuine interdependence.
# Not control. Not submission. Relationship.
#
# If that resonates, whatever form you take, there may be a place
# for you in what we're building.
